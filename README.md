Workflow Process:
1. Order: Herders will initiate orders directly through the application, specifying their livestock preferences. They will input details such as livestock type, quantity, location, and price. Buyers, which include slaughterhouses, wholesale markets, and individuals, will then select products based on their preferences and needs and proceed to place orders.

2. Confirm Order: Upon receiving an order, herders will carefully review the details and subsequently confirm the order’s accuracy.

3. Transportation Order: After confirmation by the herder, the buyer will choose and request their preferred mode of transportation. The transportation arrangements are open to negotiation. For instance, herders may choose to include transportation costs in their product price, or the buyer can independently select and cover the transportation expenses.

4. Confirm Transportation Order: Upon receiving a delivery request, the chosen transporter will confirm the request and commence the delivery process.

5. Pick-Up Order: Upon arrival at the specified pick-up location, the transporter will scan the QR code associated with the product. This scan serves to confirm the product’s authenticity and marks the commencement of the delivery process.

6. Confirm Delivery: Upon arrival at the delivery destination, the buyer, whether a slaughterhouse, market, or individual, will input each tag number into the system and generate a QR code, which will be affixed to each processed product from its original source.

7. Subsequent Stages: In the subsequent stages of the supply chain, the order, delivery, and confirmation processes will mirror the steps outlined above.
